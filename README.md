hi, we are Monsterskulls, a plural collective. we're also therian. We have TWO hosts, dont ask who the "original" is.

please refer to us by current pronouns in name or with it/they/he if none are shown

we *firmly* believe endogenic plurality is real and valid. fakeclaimers get blocked on sight

we have fictives, please be respectful to them and dont assume things about them (or us as a whole) based on their sources.

we do want to talk to people but social anxieties make it hard unless someone talks first, we may not be good at keeping up conversation

profile picture is from Pipe Up. a webcomic which can be found on tumblr

**BYi** (before you interact)
- we dont fucking care about shipping discourse we just block/mute people if something makes us uncomfortable, fictional characters are fictional. dont label us as being any stance. if this bothers you, block us, if you're too agressive with your stances and disrespect people's boundaries over it, we'll block you.
- saying again, we firmly believe endogenic systems are real. fakeclaimers and sysmeds get blocked.
- would *Strongly* prefer radqueer users not interact, *specifically ones who support harmful identities* DNi please.
- nsfw skins get hidden for 24 hours, or permanently if we see it in safe server or repeatedly
- i hide people often so if im sitting near someone dont assume i know or am talking to them.
