hyello, we're a plural collective. we're also therian. We have TWO hosts, dont ask who the "original" is. we have a [renty page](https://rentry.co/MonsterSkulls) which has a list of some stuff we like
- some avatars we use are representative of headmates we have. you can look at our [pronouns,cc page](https://pronouns.cc/@MonsterSkulls) to see some of them
- also set up a [pluralkit,xyz](https://pluralkit.xyz/f/xzjxco) for fronting (if its "switched out" that means fronters are private or unknown), it might not always be up-to-date though
- we have fictives, please be respectful to them and dont assume things about them (or us as a whole) based on their sources.
- the fictives we have sometimes use our cosplay avatars of their sources but sometimes that's someone else, if they have "plural", "sys", or "&" in the name, thats a guy (/gender neutral) and not a character
- we do want to talk to people, but we're not great at starting conversations
- we *firmly* believe endogenic plurality is real and valid. fakeclaimers get blocked on sight.

profile picture is from Pipe Up. a webcomic which can be found on tumblr

**DNi / Do NOT interact:** (or you'll face the wrath of my scarab (block button))
- anti-endos or fakeclaimers of any kind
- [radqueer](https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Radqueer) users (specifically ones who support harmful identities)
- people who are against "contradictory"/"complex" labels (eg: lesboys, afab transfems, ect)
- intersexists, [exorsexists](https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Exorsexism), Transmedicalists
- users that ai-generate content, images, text, music. yes this includes c.ai (and similar) users, write a fanfic with your keyboard,
- not an exhaustive list. we block freely.

- for plural people with some members that would fall under our dni but others who don't, use your own discretion when deciding to interact or not.

**Keep in Mind:** (aka byi / before you interact)
- we dont give a shit abt shipping discourse. don't label us as any stance bcus people cant agree what some of them mean. we just think its stupid that people will send death threats over the kinds of fiction people like. just block/mute the tags (or artists) of the stuff you dont like. the block button is free! we use it all the time!
- if i see someone using the word """proshitter""" (or other overly hostile/rude language) in their dni theres like a 60% chance i'll block over that, thats just unnecessary.
- we dont share our age publicly. we're old enough to be here thats all you need to know.
- we block freely and without mercy. 24 hours for minor offences (like nsfw skins) or permanently for major ones.
- because we hide people often, if im sitting near someone dont assume i know or am talking to them, or know they're even there.
- we dont know anything about ponytown "territories"/areas so if you see me in like some area "claimed" by a fandom/community dont assume i know whos "claimed" that area or associate with the groups that gather there.
