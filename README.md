MonsterSkulls - It/He/They

Please use masculine or gender neutral terminology when referring to me.

Call me Monster, Skulls, or the name of my character (if applicable)

I am inclusive of Good Faith identities. Such as LGBTQ+ (contradictory identities included), Furries and Therians, Plural people of all origins (endogenic and willogenic inclided),

BYI (Before You Interact): 
- I often wait for people to say things to me first to know if they want to interact.
- I don't mind being "booped" or "kissed" in games, though if it happens excessively I may hide you.
- I don't like being tightly packed in large crowds. If a crowd grows too much I may move or leave.
- I will automatically hide ponies that are too NSFW for my comfort.
- Please ask before talking about ship related things if I'm playing a cosplay character.
- I don't do RP unless its a funny bit I feel like doing.

IWC / Interact With Caution

- Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss fans (Issues revolving creator drama)
- Attack On Titan fans (Issues with the media's contents)

my dni goes both ways. if ive read your bio and you are someone i do not want to interact with (or someone who would not want to interact with me) i will block you to be polite.

i do not condone harassment in the slightest, it is not acceptable to doxx, threaten, suicide bait, or intentionally traumatize/trigger someone. If you do that kinda shit, im blocking you.

If somebody is doing shit against TOS or against Real World Laws. Report Them.
