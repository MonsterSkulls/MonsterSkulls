hi, we are Monsterskulls, a plural collective. we're also therian. We have TWO hosts. so dont ask who the "original" is.

please refer to us by current pronouns in name or with it/they/he if none are shown

we *firmly* believe endogenic plurality is real and valid. we Will block anti-endos.

we have fictives, please be respectful to them and dont assume things about them based on their sources.

we do want to talk to people but social anxieties make it hard unless someone talks first, we may not be good at keeping up conversation

profile picture is from Pipe Up. a webcomic which can be found on tumblr
