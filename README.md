MonsterSkulls - It/He/They (or whatever pronouns are in my name at the time)

Please use masculine or gender neutral terminology when referring to me.

Call me Monster, Skulls, or the name of my character (if applicable)

Sleeping = AFK / Off Tab (i accidentally press it sometimes so if i sleep for like a couple seconds im not AFK)

I have my chat range on very low and usually keep my zoom at x3, if you're not near me / not whispering I might miss your message.

I am inclusive of Good Faith identities. Such as LGBTQ+ (contradictory identities included), Furries and Therians, Plural people of all origins (endogenic and willogenic inclided),

I will automatically permanently block someone if their DNI list applies to me or is dissagreeable to me. I do this to be respectful of that users boundaries and no hard feelings are meant. Please treat me with that same respect.

**BYI / Before You Interact**: 
- I often wait for people to say things to me first to know if they want to interact.
- I don't mind being "booped" or "kissed" in game, though if it happens excessively I may ask you to stop or temporarilly hide you.
- If I am not comfortable with my pony being cuddled or covered, I will move when someone tries to. Repeated attempts may get that player temporarilly hidden.
- I might kiss avatars I like, its always in a /platonic way, and I *will not* do this if you have DNT (Do Not Touch) or similar in your name (Or in the description of a linked account)
- If I change to a grass/dirt/water colored pony, I do not want to be interacted with.
- I don't like being tightly packed in large crowds. If a crowd grows too much I may move or leave.
- I will automatically hide ponies that are too NSFW for my comfort. Including names or behaviours.
- Please ask before talking about ship related things if I'm playing a cosplay character.
- I don't do RP unless its a funny bit I feel like doing.
- Cosplay ponies I have may have pronouns that differ from canon (or common headcanons), 

**IWC / Interact With Caution** - (If you are critical of your interests and fandoms you're fine, these are ones im wary around)
- Voices of the Void fans. (I am a VOTV fan, but i do not participate in most of the community and do not associate with the drama. I do not condone any horrible actions or behavior of anyone in the community, developers included.)
- Mouthwashing fans (Fandom drama issues)
- Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss fans (Issues revolving creator drama)
- Attack On Titan fans (Issues with the media's contents)
- South Park fans (Issues with the media's contents)
- Harry Potter fans (Issues with creator and media.) / Do NOT interact if you support JK Rowling.
- Dream SMP fans (Issues with creator drama)

**DNI / Do Not Interact** (or i will block you permanently)
- "Pro-Contact" mindset towards Harmful Paraphilias (get therapy /genuine /serious)
- Racist, Homophobic, Transphobic, Intersexist, Ableist, Zionist, Nazi, Xenophobic, ect ect
- "Super Straight" or "Super Gay" because those were made up for the sake of being transphobic.
- Radqueer/Radinclus (wary of because of the more extreme/harmful forms of radqueer)
- Anti-Endo, Anti-Created Plurality,
- Ai generated content (images, music, writing, ect) supporter/user
- Crypto Currency / NFT buyer, seller, creator, ect,
- Elon Musk or Mr Beast supporter. (Will auto-hide if you're pony is based on them, even if it's a joke.)

my dni goes both ways. if ive read your bio and you are someone i do not want to interact with (or someone who would not want to interact with me) i will block you to be polite.

I (mostly) do not care about the kinds of fiction someone enjoys. I may still block someone based on the things they talk about or post for the sake of my own comfort. I'd rather someone use fiction as a way to explore darker topics than to repress those feelings and end up hurting real people.

i do not condone harassment in the slightest, it is not acceptable to doxx, threaten, suicide bait, or intentionally traumatize/trigger someone. If you do that kinda shit, im blocking you.

If somebody is doing shit against TOS or against Real World Laws. Report Them.
